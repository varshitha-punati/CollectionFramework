/*Vector implements a dynamic array. 
 * It is similar to ArrayList, but with two differences âˆ’
Vector is synchronized.
Vector contains many legacy methods that are not part of the collections framework.
Vector proves to be very useful if you don't know the size of the array in 
advance or you just need one that can change sizes over the lifetime of a program.
